## üöò Ethical Decision-Making with Transformers

This project fine-tunes a DistilBERT model to classify ethical decisions in **autonomous vehicle moral dilemmas**, such as choosing between protecting a pedestrian vs. the vehicle's occupants. It's designed to model moral reasoning using real and synthetic survey data.

---

### üìå Project Goals

* Fine-tune a transformer on moral judgment data
* Classify ethical responses into:

  * `üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pedestrian Priority`
  * `üöó Occupant Priority`
  * `ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Uncertain / Random`
* Evaluate performance with accuracy and F1-score
* Deploy a **Gradio-based interactive demo**

---

### üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is a combination of:

* Ethical decision survey responses (Google Form CSV)
* Paraphrased and augmented variants to expand classes
* Total samples: **86**
* Labels:

  * `0` ‚Üí Pedestrian
  * `1` ‚Üí Occupant
  * `2` ‚Üí Uncertain / Random

### üß† Model

* **Base Model**: [`distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)
* **Fine-tuning Task**: Sequence classification (3-class)
* **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss
* **Optimizer**: AdamW

### üèóÔ∏è Training Pipeline

```python
1. Load and label data from CSV
2. Tokenize using Hugging Face tokenizer
3. Convert into PyTorch Dataset & Dataloader
4. Fine-tune DistilBERT for 10 epochs
5. Evaluate using classification report (F1, precision, recall)
```

#### ‚úÖ Sample Training Output:

```
Epoch 10 ‚Äî Loss: 0.2417
Accuracy: 64%
```

### üìä Evaluation Results

| Label        | Precision | Recall | F1   | Support |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| Pedestrian   | 0.48      | 1.00   | 0.65 | 29      |
| Occupant     | 1.00      | 0.42   | 0.59 | 26      |
| Uncertain    | 1.00      | 0.48   | 0.65 | 31      |
| **Accuracy** |           |        | 0.64 | 86      |

### üöÄ Future Improvements

* Increase dataset size to >500 samples
* Include explanation generation (why model chose the decision)
* Fine-tune larger models (e.g., BERT or RoBERTa)
* Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces
